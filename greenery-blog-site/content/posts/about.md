# About This Site

This site is a blog based on Hugo, mainly used to document my studies and life.

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is incredibly fast and supports Markdown syntax. It uses Go templates, so its usage is quite similar to other generators like Helm.

# About Me

I am a soon-to-be graduate student. I am studying for a master's degree in Computer Engineering at NUS. My undergraduate degree is in Computer Science and Technology from a 985 university, where I ranked quite high, but I still feel there is much to learn. I wanted to see the world, so I came to Singapore.

Here is my resume:

## My Tech Stack

### Programming Languages
- **C/C++**: Used during my undergraduate studies for coursework, but I am not proficient. Recently, I've been reviewing it on learncpp.com.
- **Python**: I've written some data processing, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning code with Python and worked independently on several research projects. I am fairly familiar with it, though I don't particularly like Python's syntax, as it is not ideal for building reliable projects.
- **Go**: The first production-level language I mastered. I use it to write backend services, tools, scripts, crawlers, etc. I quite like Go's syntax, concurrency model, standard library, and toolchain.
- **Java**: Learned object-oriented programming with Java during my undergraduate studies. Bought a course on how2j during my sophomore year but haven't gotten around to it. I believe I could learn it within two weeks if I had the time.
- **Shell**: Used to write simple scripts for tasks like automated deployment, backups, and cleanup.
- **JavaScript**: Used for writing simple AJAX. Planning to learn TypeScript and React when I have time.
- **Rust**: A language I am very eager to learn, though I am hesitant due to job opportunities. I plan to learn it once my situation is more stable.

### Domain Knowledge
- **Backend Technologies**: Mainly web development, distributed systems, databases, caching, message queues, etc.
- **Cloud-Native Technologies**: Mainly Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, ArgoCD, Argo Workflow, etc.
- **Computer Networks**: Mainly TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, etc.
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning, reinforcement learning. I've worked with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.
- **Data Analysis**: Data processing, data visualization. Proficient with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

### In Progress
- **Leetcode Algorithms**: Continuously practicing, seems endless...
- **Go Projects**: Working on some projects to systematically review Go's syntax and various data components.
- **Kubernetes**: Currently studying it, hoping to produce some articles about Kubernetes.
- **C++**: Currently reading, two chapters per week.
- **Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Industrial Applications**: Working on this project with my professor, almost ready to write a paper.

## My Life
In my spare time, I hang out with friends and recently went to Malaysia for a trip. I enjoy eating, playing games, and reading manga. Anyone else a fan of "Baki" and "Kengan Ashura"?
