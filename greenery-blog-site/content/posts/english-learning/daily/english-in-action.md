# English Learning Daily

When composing my blog, I initially write in Chinese and then translate the content into English. This approach allows me to practice English more effectively and gain a deeper understanding of the differences between Chinese and English.

While writing the blog, I have the opportunity to learn new English vocabulary and expressions. This method has proven to be highly beneficial for my language learning process.

I analyze the English translations provided by ChatGPT, noting the vocabulary, expressions, and grammar used. This analytical approach significantly enhances my English learning experience.

The articles in this series are named using the format: 20010203-english-in-blog.md, where 20010203 represents the date, and english-in-blog is the article title.
